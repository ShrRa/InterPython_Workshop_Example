# Introduction
This is a template software project repository used by the [Intermediate Python for Astronomical Software Development](https://shrra.github.io/python-intermediate-development/index.html).

## Purpose

This repository is intended to be used as a code template which is copied by learners at [Intermediate Python for Astronomical Software Development](https://shrra.github.io/python-intermediate-development/index.html) course.
This can be done using the `Use this template` button towards the top right of this repo's GitHub page.

This software project is not finished, is currently failing to run and contains some code style issues. It is used as a starting point for the course - issues will be fixed and code will be added in a number of places during the course by learners in their own copies of the repository, as course topics are introduced.

## Tests

Several tests have been implemented already, some of which are currently failing.
These failing tests set out the requirements for the additional code to be implemented during the workshop.
